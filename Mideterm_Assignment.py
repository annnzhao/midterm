    print(f"Average accuracy for {D} dimensions: {avg_accuracy}")


# The result illustrates that as the number of dimensions increases, the accuracy initially improves, reaching a peak at 64 dimensions, and then declines. This pattern suggests there's an optimal level of complexity beyond which adding more dimensions doesn't improve or even worsens the prediction accuracy. This aligns with the principle of the information limit of 2 prediction bits per parameter, indicating a boundary where additional information (or dimensions) no longer contributes to, and can even detract from, the effectiveness of nearest neighbor predictions.

# The main differences when applying the algorithms to different datasets, such as Iris and Breast Cancer, include the complexity of the generated rules and the accuracy achieved. The Iris dataset, when reduced to a binary classification problem, might yield simpler and fewer rules due to clear separability between classes, often resulting in higher accuracy with basic models. The Breast Cancer dataset, being inherently binary but with more complex features, might generate more intricate rules and potentially face a slightly more challenging task in achieving high accuracy due to subtler distinctions between classes.

# ### (b)
# 
# In the scenario where we are dealing with a long random string generated from a mix of ASCII letters and digits, the expected compression ratio is likely to be close to 1. This means that there might be little to no effective compression, and in some cases, the compressed size could be slightly larger than the original due to overhead.
# 
# The reason for this is that compression algorithms typically rely on finding patterns, repetitions, or predictability in the data to achieve compression. A truly random string, by definition, lacks such patterns or predictability, making it difficult for compression algorithms to reduce its size significantly.

# Total Sensory Experience: The rough estimate for the total sensory experience (visual and auditory) in bits over an average human lifespan of 80 years is approximately
# 2.33 × 10^19 bits.
# 
# 
# Shakespeare's Works: The information content of the complete works of Shakespeare is estimated to be
# 2.5 × 10^7 bits (or 25 million bits).
# 
# 
# Brain Capacity: The estimated information capacity of the human brain, assuming 10 ^11neurons, each making 1000 synaptic connections with 2 bits per connection, is 2×10 ^14 bits.
# 
# 10 ^11 neurons × 10^3 connections/neuron × 2 bits/connection = 2×10 ^14 bits
# 
# 
# The total sensory experience is orders of magnitude larger (
# 10^5 times) than the brain's capacity to store information, highlighting the brain's ability to compress and abstract information significantly.
# 
# The works of Shakespeare would occupy a minuscule fraction of the brain's storage capacity, underscoring the vast potential of the human brain to store information.
# 
# Despite the brain's impressive capacity, the comparison shows that our sensory experiences far exceed what could be stored in raw form, emphasizing the importance of the brain's mechanisms for filtering, compressing, and prioritizing information.

# For the experiment with blind variations of hyperparameters and architectures, a simple change such as increasing the depth of the network and adjusting learning rate led to slight improvements in accuracy. Specifically, a deeper network with more convolutional layers and a lower learning rate improved the accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set from around 50% to approximately 60%.
# 
# Applying systematic measurements and reducing the hyperparameter search space, as proposed, for example, by focusing on optimal learning rates and regularization techniques, the network's performance increased to around 70% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set. This shows the importance of a structured approach in hyperparameter tuning and architectural decisions for enhancing model performance.
